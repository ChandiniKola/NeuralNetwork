Problem 1 and 2 : Na√Øve Bayes and Linear SVM

From the executed result the Linear SVM has more accurate score than Naive Bayes.

In general the choice between Naive Bayes and Linear SVM will depend on the specific problem being solved, the nature of the data, and the computational resources available.

Problem 3 : Linear Regression using scikit-learn

Calculated mean_squared error and visualized both train and test data using scatter plot.
